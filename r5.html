    <h1>The Midnight Library</h1>
    <p>"The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig is a novel that delves into the theme of regret and the pursuit of happiness. While the book doesn't offer a defined "mission" in a traditional sense, its central message revolves around the idea of embracing life as it is, appreciating the choices we've made, and finding contentment in the present.</p>

      <h3>1. Choices and Regrets:</h3>
      <div class="theme-item">
        <p>The book suggests that every choice we make creates a different version of our life. Regret comes from dwelling on the unlived possibilities rather than appreciating the choices we've made and the life we have.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> By experiencing these different lives, Nora, the protagonist, learns that regret isn't about the things she has done but the things she hasnâ€™t. Her journey aims to show that life is a series of choices and consequences, and it's about accepting them rather than yearning for what could have been.</p>

        <p>Happiness is not found in the pursuit of the "perfect" life but in accepting the life we have.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Nora discovers that the search for happiness lies not in trying to find the perfect life but in finding contentment in the life she already has. Each life she explores in the Midnight Library has its own set of problems, demonstrating that no life is without challenges.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>4. Embracing the Present:</h3>
      <div class="theme-item">
        <p>Life is not about dwelling on the past or fantasizing about the future, but about being present in the moment.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Nora comes to the realization that living in the present moment is the key to happiness. Rather than lamenting the past or worrying about the future, she learns to appreciate the beauty of the present.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>5. Interconnectedness:</h3>
      <div class="theme-item">
        <p>The book suggests that every life has an impact on others, and sometimes the smallest of actions can create significant changes.</p>
